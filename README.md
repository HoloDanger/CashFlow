### Initial Plan

Task: Implement Money Tracker App

Description:
This task involves developing a Money Tracker App from scratch, including documenting requirements, setting up the development environment, planning and implementing features, and conducting thorough testing.

Objective:
To create a fully functional Money Tracker App that allows users to log transactions, manage budgets, generate reports, and export data.

Implementation Plan:
Step 1: Understand Project Requirements (project_requirements.md)
Create a file named project_requirements.md.
Document the main features: Transaction Logging, Budgeting, Reports, Export.
Outline the objectives and goals of the project.
Step 2: Set Up Development Environment (setup_guide.md)
Create a file named setup_guide.md.
Install Flutter SDK and Dart.
Set up Android Studio or VS Code with Flutter plugins.
Verify the installation by running a sample Flutter app.
Step 3: Plan App Features and UI (ui_sketches/)
Create a directory named ui_sketches.
Sketch the basic design of the app including home screen, navigation menu, and transaction entry screen.
Document the planned features and UI elements.
Step 4: Develop Basic UI (lib/screens/)
Create a directory named lib/screens.
Develop the home screen UI.
Develop the navigation menu.
Develop the transaction entry screen.
Step 5: Implement State Management (lib/state_management/)
Create a directory named lib/state_management.
Choose a state management solution (e.g., Provider, Riverpod).
Implement state management for the home screen.
Implement state management for the transaction entry screen.
Step 6: Set Up Local Database (lib/database/)
Create a directory named lib/database.
Add SQLite dependency to pubspec.yaml.
Set up SQLite database and tables for transactions.
Step 7: Create Database Functions (lib/database/transaction_dao.dart)
Create a file named lib/database/transaction_dao.dart.
Implement functions to add transactions.
Implement functions to retrieve transactions.
Implement functions to update transactions.
Implement functions to delete transactions.
Step 8: Integrate Frontend and Backend (lib/)
Connect the UI with the database functions.
Ensure that transaction entries are stored in the database.
Ensure that transaction data is retrieved and displayed correctly.
Step 9: Test the App (test/)
Create a directory named test.
Write test cases for transaction logging.
Write test cases for budgeting.
Write test cases for data retrieval.
Step 10: Implement Additional Features (lib/features/)
Create a directory named lib/features.
Implement data visualization (graphs or charts).
Implement export to CSV functionality.
Step 11: Test Additional Features (test/features/)
Create a directory named test/features.
Write test cases for data visualization.
Write test cases for export to CSV.
Step 12: Final Testing (test/final/)
Create a directory named test/final.
Perform end-to-end testing.
Fix any remaining issues.
Step 13: Prepare for Release (release/)
Create a directory named release.
Set the app icon.
Set the version number.
Package the app for distribution.

Integration Points:
The UI components will integrate with the state management solution.
The state management will interact with the local SQLite database.
The database functions will handle CRUD operations for transactions.
Additional features like data visualization and export will integrate with the existing transaction data.

Risks and Mitigation Strategies:
Risk: Difficulty in setting up the development environment.
Mitigation Strategy: Provide a detailed setup guide and verify the installation with a sample app.

Risk: Inconsistent state management leading to UI issues.
Mitigation Strategy: Choose a well-documented state management solution and follow best practices.

Risk: Data loss or corruption in the local database.
Mitigation Strategy: Implement thorough testing and data validation.

Risk: Performance issues with large datasets.
Mitigation Strategy: Optimize database queries and use efficient data structures.

Testing Strategy:
Unit Tests: Test individual components and functions, including state management and database functions.
Integration Tests: Test the interaction between UI components, state management, and the database.
System Tests: Conduct end-to-end testing of the entire app, including all features and user flows.
Performance Tests: Test the app's performance with large datasets and under various conditions.

Time Estimation:
8 weeks with a 20% buffer for unexpected issues.
