## Introduction

CashFlow is a mobile application designed to help users track their daily expenses and manage their finances. Built with Flutter, CashFlow provides a simple and intuitive interface for users to log their transactions and visualize their spending habits.

## Features

- **Transaction Logging**: Easily input your income and expenses across various categories.
- **Budgeting**: Set monthly or weekly budgets and track your spending against these budgets.
- **Reports**: Visualize your transaction history with beautiful and intuitive graphs.
- **Export**: Export your transaction history to CSV for further analysis.

## Technology Stack

CashFlow is built using Flutter and Dart, offering the following benefits for mobile app development:

- **Flutter**: Provides a single codebase for both iOS and Android, enabling faster development and consistent UI across platforms.
- **Dart**: Offers a reactive and performant programming language that integrates seamlessly with Flutter for building robust mobile applications.

## Architecture Overview

The CashFlow project follows a typical Flutter architecture pattern, such as the BLoC (Business Logic Component) pattern or Provider pattern. The UI components interact with the business logic layer to manage state and data flow. Data is stored locally using a database, and there may be services for handling API calls or external integrations.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Flutter 2.0 or later
- Dart 2.12.0 or later
- Android Studio, with an emulator set up for testing
- Visual Studio Code for development

### Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/HoloDanger/CashFlow.git`
2. Navigate into the project directory: `cd CashFlow`
3. Install dependencies: `flutter pub get`
4. Run the app: `flutter run`

## Development Plan

The development of the CashFlow app is divided into several steps:

1. Understand Project Requirements
2. Set Up Development Environment
3. Plan App Features and UI
4. Develop Basic UI
5. Implement State Management
6. Set Up Local Database
7. Create Database Functions
8. Integrate Frontend and Backend
9. Test the App
10. Implement Additional Features
11. Test Additional Features
12. Final Testing
13. Prepare for Release

Each step involves specific tasks that contribute to the development of the app. For more detailed information about each step, please refer to the [Project Requirements](project_requirements.md) section in the project documentation.

## Risks and Mitigation Strategies

- **Risk**: Difficulty in setting up the development environment.
  - **Mitigation Strategy**: Provide a detailed setup guide and verify the installation with a sample app.
- **Risk**: Inconsistent state management leading to UI issues.
  - **Mitigation Strategy**: Choose a well-documented state management solution and follow best practices.
- **Risk**: Data loss or corruption in the local database.
  - **Mitigation Strategy**: Implement thorough testing and data validation.

## Security Practices

CashFlow implements security practices to protect user data, such as data encryption, secure storage mechanisms, and user authentication. Measures are taken to ensure data privacy and security, following best practices to build trust with users regarding the handling of their sensitive information.

## Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual components and functions, including state management and database functions.
- **Integration Tests**: Test the interaction between UI components, state management, and the database.
- **System Tests**: Conduct end-to-end testing of the entire app, including all features and user flows.
- **Performance Tests**: Test the app's performance with large datasets and under various conditions.

## Time Estimation

The development of the CashFlow app is estimated to take 8 weeks, with a 20% buffer for unexpected issues.

## Future Roadmap

The future enhancements planned for the CashFlow app include:

- Integration with cloud storage for data backup.
- Implementation of predictive budgeting features based on spending patterns.
- Enhancement of reporting capabilities with customizable graphs and charts.
