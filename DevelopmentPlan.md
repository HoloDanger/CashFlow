## Understand Project Requirements

Step 1: Understand Project Requirements (project_requirements.md)
Create a file named project_requirements.md.
Document the main features: Transaction Logging, Budgeting, Reports, Export.
Outline the objectives and goals of the project.

## Set Up Development Environment

Step 2: Set Up Development Environment (setup_guide.md)
Create a file named setup_guide.md.
Install Flutter SDK and Dart.
Set up Android Studio or VS Code with Flutter plugins.
Verify the installation by running a sample Flutter app.

## Plan App Features and UI

Step 3: Plan App Features and UI (ui_sketches/)
